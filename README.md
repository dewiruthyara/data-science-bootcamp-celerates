# 🎓 Data Science Bootcamp Coursework - Celerates School
This repository documents the core modules and practical exercises completed during the Data Science Basic training program at Celerates School.

The content progresses from Python fundamentals to essential data analysis and includes a practical A/B Testing case study using key data science libraries.

# 🌟 Key Modules & Topics Covered
The repository is organized by learning day and covers the following main topics:

Python Fundamentals: Syntax, data types (Numeric, String, List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary), control flow (If/Else, For, While), Exception Handling, and basic functions/Lambda.

Data Science Ecosystem: Introduction to the roles of Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Business Analyst.

Numerical Computing (NumPy): Working with 1D and Multidimensional Arrays (Matrices), array creation, indexing (including boolean indexing), and basic mathematical operations.

Data Manipulation (Pandas): Creating, loading, preparing (EDA: info(), describe(), dtypes), and analyzing structured data (DataFrame).

Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn): Generating bar plots and histograms to visualize data distributions and conversion rates.

Statistical Analysis (A/B Testing): Practical application of inferential statistics using Two Independent Sample T-test and Two Proportion Z-test to draw business conclusions.
